# sage

Sage is an AI copilot designed to enhance developer productivity and streamline onboarding processes. By suggesting and autocompleting terminal commands, it significantly reduces the time developers spend on routine tasks.

Many companies have specific commands for their teams and projects. With Sage, developers no longer need to waste time searching through documentation or asking colleagues for help with these commands.

Sage stores historical commands used by team members, allowing it to provide relevant suggestions based on context. It features an extension that records successfully executed commands in real-time, with built-in data redaction through Hugging Face for privacy protection. These commands are stored in a vector database, enabling hybrid search and reranking retrieval. Additionally, Sage offers RAG-based code completion for command-line suggestions, further enhancing its usability.
